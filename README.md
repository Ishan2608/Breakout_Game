# Breakout Game
In this Python project developed using the "turtle" library, I present a delightful clone of the classic Breakout game. Players will experience a thrilling challenge as they control a paddle to bounce a ball and break through a wall of colourful bricks. With vibrant visuals, dynamic gameplay mechanics, and progressively challenging levels, this clone tries to capture the essence of the original game while adding my personal touch. Prepare for an addictive and nostalgic gaming experience that will keep you entertained for hours!
